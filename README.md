## CodewarsTracker
### By Lawrence Karanja

## Description
This is a very simple web application that displays in a tabular format a list of codewars users and their total points. This first version can successfully fetch
the users that are saved in a json file.

### Improvements
1. Improve on speed of calls to the Codewars API.
2. Increase efficiency of how the response is processed
3. Enable sorting based on different predefined parameters such as who has the most points or who has completed the most Katas

##### I''m open to any help or pointers

### Libraries Used
1. JavaSpark
2. Velocity Template Engine
3. ##### Codewars API
